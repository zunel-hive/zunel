//! Library surface for the `zunel-mcp-self` crate.
//!
//! The dispatcher is expressed behind the [`McpDispatcher`] trait and the
//! transport layer in [`http`] runs against any implementation of that
//! trait, so other commands (notably `zunel mcp agent --profile NAME`)
//! can reuse the same Streamable-HTTP/HTTPS transport with a different
//! tool set.
//!
//! Two dispatchers ship in this crate:
//!
//! - [`SelfDispatcher`] — the zunel-self tools (sessions, cron,
//!   channels, token usage, …). Backs both the stdio binary entry point
//!   and `zunel mcp serve`.
//! - [`MapDispatcher`] — a thin construct used in tests to assert
//!   transport behavior without standing up a real registry.
//!
//! Downstream callers (e.g. `zunel-cli`) implement their own
//! `McpDispatcher` and pass it to [`http::run`].
