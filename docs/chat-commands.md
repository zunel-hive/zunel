# In-Chat Commands

These commands work inside Slack conversations and local interactive agent sessions:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Stop current task and start a new conversation |
| `/stop` | Stop the current task |
| `/restart` | Restart the bot |
| `/status` | Show bot status |
| `/dream` | Run Dream memory consolidation now |
| `/dream-log` | Show the latest Dream memory change |
| `/dream-log <sha>` | Show a specific Dream memory change |
| `/dream-restore` | List recent Dream memory versions |
| `/dream-restore <sha>` | Restore memory to the state before a specific change |
| `/help` | Show available in-chat commands |

## Periodic Tasks

The gateway wakes up every 30 minutes and checks `HEARTBEAT.md` in your
workspace (`~/.zunel/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md`). If the file has tasks, the agent
executes them and delivers results to your most recently active Slack
conversation.

**Setup:** edit `~/.zunel/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md` (created automatically by
`zunel onboard`):

```markdown
## Periodic Tasks

- [ ] Check weather forecast and send a summary
- [ ] Scan inbox for urgent emails
```

The agent can also manage this file itself — ask it to "add a periodic task" and it will update `HEARTBEAT.md` for you.

> **Note:** The gateway must be running (`zunel gateway`) and you must have
> chatted with the bot at least once so it knows which Slack target to deliver
> to.
